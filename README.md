[GitHub](https://github.com/tomBoddaert/dynode)

## [`dynode`](/dynode/README.md)
A framework for making node-based structures with dynamically-sized values.

This is the base library for the project. It implements generic nodes with defined allocation functions and other utilities.

## [`dyn_list`](/dyn_list/README.md)
A linked list that can hold dynamically-sized types.

This is the most basic of the `dynode` structures.
